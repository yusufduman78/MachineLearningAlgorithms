# 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms Collection

Welcome to my personal repository containing implementations of various machine learning algorithms and exploratory data analysis projects. This repository aims to demonstrate foundational machine learning concepts through hands-on Python code and real-world datasets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 1. Linear Regression Implementation

A from-scratch implementation of a Linear Regression model without relying on external machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

- **Location:** `MyRegression/MyRegression.py`  
- **Features:**  
  - Custom Linear Regression class  
  - Feature scaling support  
  - Multiple regression capability  
  - Performance metrics including MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared  
- **Purpose:**  
  Understand the inner workings of Linear Regression by building it from the ground up.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

Projects focused on data exploration and preliminary machine learning modeling on different datasets.

- **Heart Disease Analysis:**  
  - **Notebook:** `Exploratory Data Analysis/heart_disease.ipynb`  
  - **Dataset:** `datasets/heart_2020_cleaned.csv`  
  - **Description:** Data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to assess heart disease risk.

- **Rental Price Prediction:**  
  - **Notebook:** `Exploratory Data Analysis/rent_price.ipynb`  
  - **Dataset:** `datasets/rent_price_dataset_buca.csv`  
  - **Description:** Analysis and modeling of rental prices in the Buca area using regression algorithms like Linear Regression and KNN Regressor.

### 3. Datasets

Raw datasets used across the projects are stored here for easy access and reproducibility.

- `datasets/heart_2020_cleaned.csv` — Cleaned heart disease dataset  
- `datasets/rent_price_dataset_buca.csv` — Rental price dataset from Buca

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yusufduman78/MachineLearningAlgorithms.git
    cd MachineLearningAlgorithms
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook for EDA projects:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the desired `.ipynb` file in your browser.

4. Run the linear regression script directly:
    ```bash
    python MyRegression/MyRegression.py
    ```
